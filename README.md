# n8n-nodes-ik-bq

This is an n8n community node. It's a modification to the original Google BigQuery module.

The node is almost exactly the same as the BigQuery mode, but it has a custom query operation added when getting records.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
